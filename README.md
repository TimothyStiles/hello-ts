## hello-ts

hello-ts is just a simple example / template for getting started with test driven development in typescript.

I'm not a typescript/javascript dev but it's the only language you can really use to program extensions for VS-code which I have a need for at the moment.

This has almost been entirely copied from this [article](https://www.typescriptbites.io/articles/build-test-and-publish-typescript-npm-package-2022) by [@janis_t on twitter](https://twitter.com/janis_t) and has worked *on my machine*. 

It's very likely to work on your machine as well but I offer no warranties and am not offering support beyond bug fixes unless someone wants to sponsor me for that for some reason.

TTFN and Happy Hacking!
